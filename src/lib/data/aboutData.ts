  'For the past 2+ years, Iâ€™ve been further enhancing my skills at a media company as a developer in the marketing tech team.  I thrive in Agile environments, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality solutions efficiently. My skill set includes both front-end and back-end development, with proficiency in JavaScript, React, Next.js and Node.js. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with WordPress, Segment, GTM, GA, and conducting code reviews.<br> Outside of work, I love to <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/29960619" target="_blank">exercise</a>. Being a D1 rower in college, I learned about pushing yourself to your limits and how your mind can be your worst enemy in uncomfortable situations, whether it be in sports or your job. Upon graduating, I sought out running to continue to challenge myself and have completed 5 marathons since. Some other hobbies of mine include <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120192094-amanda-baydar" target="_blank">reading</a>, strategic boardgaming, and watching movies/shows.'
